1. Control flows
2. Data structures (loops, lists, tuples)


when to use tuple and when to use list

Lists and tuples are both used to store collections of items in Python, but they have key differences that determine when each should be used.
Lists: Lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after creation. They are defined using square brackets [].
Use lists when you need to modify the collection, such as adding, removing, or changing elements.
They are suitable for storing collections of similar items (homogeneous data).


Tuples: Tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation. They are defined using parentheses ().
Use tuples when you need to ensure that the data remains constant throughout the program's execution.
They are suitable for storing collections of different types of items (heterogeneous data).
Tuples can be unpacked, allowing you to assign their elements to individual variables.
