ML -> supervised and unsupervised 
supervised -> classification and Regressions

create a model , train the model with multiple features (dataset), then its capable to predict 
f1, f2, f3, f4 .... features 

some features -> text

Example : Spam classification -> Email is spam or not

Email subject, body is input    is spam -> output

Billionere "You won a lottory of 1 billion" 1 (span yes)

cleaning the text : input text -> vectors
step1
Text preprocessing - tokenization, summarization, stemming, stopwords

step2
Text preprocessing - Bag of words, TFIDF, unigram

step3
Text preprocessing - word2vec, Avgword2vec

Neural network (Deep Learning)
step4
RNN, LSTM RNN, GRU RNN

step5
Text preprocessing - word embedding

step6
Transformers

step7
BERT

step1,2,3 - Machine Learning
step4,5,6,7 -> NLTK, tensorflow/pytorch
