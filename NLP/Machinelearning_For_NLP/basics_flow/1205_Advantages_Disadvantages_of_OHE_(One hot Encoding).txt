Advantages of OHE (One hot Encoding) : 
1. Easy to implement with python (using sklearn OHE, pd.get_dummies)

Disadvantages of OHE:
1. Sparse Matrix -> Overfitting
2. ML Algorithms -> Fixed size input is needed. (Dimensions of matrix varies here) 
3. No Semantic meaning is getting captured.

4. Out of vocabulary (OOV) : we can't represent not existed words while testing. if new word comes for testing this method fails.
